Hashtag-Orchestra
=================

#HashtagOrchestra Is an app that tracks multiple hashtags and outputs sound based on how often certain things are tweeted about.

Developed in processing

Objective:
This project will serve as an installation piece that will comment on how often we tweet about certain topics. I want it to initially address the amount of time we spend talking about topics such as Pop Culture, current events, events/conventions, influential people, and music. It will follow certain tags on twitter and each bird will produce a tonal sound based on how often the topic is tweeted about. There will also be a sub-group of birds that will follow tags relating to the main topics, these birds will be physically smaller. Since these topics are constantly discussed the tonal noises will create a musical composition.
